[Investment Performance Web API](InvestmentPerformanceWebAPI.md#investment-performance-web-api)
I was assigned the Investment Performance Web API exercise. Please see below for comments:

This was a great exercise. I got a little hung up with automapper and also having some trouble with my routes. I am unable to hit the endpoints correctly. I am still trying to get them to work but I wanted to get my submission in before the weekend. 

This project uses Swagger UI and should run when executing the code. You will need to input the userId for a list of investments for that user and the userId and investmentId for specific details about that investment. NOTE: The routes are unsuccessful upon submission. 

The API should have the ability to Get a list of current investments for a user and return that investment by userId and investmentId. It should also have the capability to Get specific details about any investment. The api also has put and delete calls to buy and sell investments. 

I appreciate any and all constructive criticism and I look forward to any future discussions about this particular exercise and answering any questions you may have.
