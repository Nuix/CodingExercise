# Coding Exercise

[Investment Performance Web API](InvestmentPerformanceWebAPI.md#investment-performance-web-api)
I was assigned the Investment Performance Web API exercise. Please see below for comments:

This project uses Swagger UI and should run when executing the code. You will need to input the userId for a list of investments for that user and the userId and investmentId for specific details about that investment. 

The API should has the ability to Get a list of current investments for a user and return that investment by userId and investmentId. It has the capability to Get specific details about any investment. The api also has put and delete calls to buy and sell investments.
