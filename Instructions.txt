DATA PROVIDERS
The data that was created uses a DbContext based on the models needed for the data to be returned.  I didn't have SQL installed on my home system, so I just created faker data to be returned.  During my testing, I ended up changing one of the models which ended up causing a conflict in my database.  I had issues getting the database to update to the new model so I coded around this issue, but the APIs still return the requested data.
